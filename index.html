      <h2>My Hobbies Include:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Video Games</li>
        <li>Watching Youtube</li>
        <li>Working out</li>
        <li>Skateboarding</li>
        <li>Playing Guitar</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After class you can catch me playing video games on either
        PC or PS4. I also play alot of guitar whenever I get home which
        is a hobby I picked up along with skateboarding whenever I 
        get a chance to go out to the park or just skate to class.
        Usually I try my best to go to the gym everyday but recently the UREC 
        has been packed so I avoid going.

      <h2>My Favorite types of Food:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Seafood (Shrimp)</li>
        <li>Popcorn</li>
        <li>Any type of fruit</li>
        <li>Pasta</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For some reason I really enjoy seafood, probably because Ive lived near
        water most of my life. Popcorn is always a good snack that I like, even if Im not at 
        the movies, theres alot of popcorn in my pantry at home. 
        I used to live in Italy when I was younger because
        my mom was military so from a young age Ive always liked pasta 
        especially Alfredo.
